## How To Use run_analysis.R
1. Begin by downloading the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" from the
UCI Machine Learning [repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
1. Unzip the dataset to a directory on your local machine
1. Place the 'run_analysis.R' script in the same parent directory as the UCI HAR Dataset folder
1. Open R and cwd() into the directory where 'run_analysis.R' and the UCI HAR Dataset folder exists
1. Type 'source("run_analysis.R")' and press Enter
1. Type 'runAnalysis()' and press Enter
1. The tidy dataset will be in a file named "tidy_dataset.txt"

**NB**: run_analysis.R and "UCI HAR Data" *must* to be the same directory in order for this script to work.
